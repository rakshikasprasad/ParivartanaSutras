        <h2 class="page-title">A Tribute to Seshan Guruji (Prof. P.A.Seshan) – My Beloved Mentor, a Master Beyond Compare</h2>
        <p>There are some souls who walk this earth once
 in a generation. Rare jewels who embody an
 ocean of knowledge, wisdom, and boundless
 love. </p>
        <p>Seshan Guruji (Prof. P.A. Seshan) was one such
 being. He was an ocean of knowledge, with
 deep, piercing yogic eyes, eyes that seemed to
 hold the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the
 unspoken wisdom of the universe. Every word
 he uttered felt like an echo from the ancient
 Rishis, yet every glance he gave felt like a
 father’s tender blessing. His words carried the
 weight of ancient truths, yet they were so
 accessible, so practical, and so deeply infused
 with love.</p>
        <p>Seshan Guruji was a master of masters, a rare
 blend of academic brilliance, spiritual depth,
 and practical wisdom. A University Gold
 Medalist in English Literature, an All-India First
 Rank Holder in the 1955 Civil Services (IAAS),
 and a visionary leader in both public and private
 sectors, he held senior positions like Executive
 Director of BHEL, Vice-President of Bhilwara
 Group, and Executive Director of Keltron.</p>
 <p>He also helped establish the Management
 Development Institute (MDI) in Gurgaon and
 taught leadership, strategy, and finance as a
 Professor of Management.</p>
 <p>Even at the pinnacle of his corporate career, he
 never saw a divide between the boardroom and
 spiritual practice. He was the rarest of minds
 who could traverse seamlessly from the
 boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies to the
 sanctums of esoteric traditions like Sri Vidya.
 He lived the synthesis of the worldly and the
 spiritual, a rare integration that few could ever
 achieve.</p>
 <p>As a seeker, his thirst for knowledge was
 insatiable. He learnt Hatha Yoga from stalwarts
 like T. Krishnamacharya, Kundalini Yoga from
 Swami Vethathiri Maharishi, and was honored
 as an “Arul Nidhi” for his mastery.</p>
 <p>He travelled to Japan to learn Soto Zen from
 Master Haku-un Enomiya-Lassalle, becoming
 one of the few Indian teachers of authentic
 Japanese Zen.</p>
 <p>He was a Vedic scholar, a devotee of Hanuman,
 and a Sri Vidya master initiated into the sacred
 tradition by Sri Amritananda Natha Saraswati of
 Devipuram, who gave him the monastic name
 Amritapadananda Natha.</p>
 <p> He was a walking library, a master of the Vedas,
 Upanishads, and mantras. I still remember how
 he would sit surrounded by thousands of books
 and tell you exactly where to find a particular
 line on a particular page.</p>
 <p>His memory was extraordinary, his intellect
 razor-sharp. And yet, despite his towering
 intellect, he was the most humble and
 compassionate teacher, always ready to guide,
 never withholding his wisdom.</p>
 <p>His hands would lovingly pass on the 64
 Parivarthana Sutras, printed on simple A4
 papers, telling us, “This is all you need. If you
 master this, your life will be transformed.” And
 he was right.</p>
 <p>These 64 Parivarthana Sutras are a treasure, a
 lifetime of knowledge distilled into practical,
 transformative principles.</p>
 <p>As a mental health professional, I can say with
 conviction that these teachings on mind-body
 alignment and inner discipline have given me
 insights far beyond any textbook or clinical
 training. They form the framework for ultimate
 well-being</p>
 <p>This site is my humble attempt to share the 
64 Parivarthana Sutras that Guruji so
 generously imparted, a treasure that must not
 be lost to time.</p>
 <p>Seshan Guruji’s grace was oceanic. He
 embodied the essence of Zen stillness, Sri Vidya
 devotion, and yogic power.</p>
 <p>His workshops on stress management,
 prosperity, and meditation guided over 10,000
 professionals, helping them navigate life’s
 challenges with clarity and composure.</p>
 <p>He taught that every single cell of the body
 should resonate with the mantra when you
 pray, a teaching that still echoes within me. His
 words, “99% is failure; aim for 100% alignment,”
 were not just guidance but a call to inner
 mastery.</p>
 <p> There are no words deep enough to capture the
 privilege of learning from such a master.My eyes well up when I think of him. His
 presence was love itself, his mind a vast
 universe, his heart a fountain of compassion.</p>
 <p>It is a sacred responsibility and a blessing to
 carry forward his vision, especially the 64
 Parivarthana Sutras, as a foundational
 framework for mental health and inner
 transformation.</p>
 <p>His life was a living bridge between corporate
 leadership and yogic mastery, between strategic
 thinking and spiritual awakening.</p>
 <p>To me, he was not just a mentor. He was a light,
 a force of nature, a soul who embodied the
 infinite.</p>
 <p>I will forever cherish the grace of his gaze, the
 warmth of his words, and the silent power of
 his presence. Seshan Guruji, you live on in every breath, every
 prayer, every act of service I offer to this world.</p>
 <p> May your blessings continue to inspire and
 guide all who walk the path you illuminated, for
 generations to come.</p>
 <p>With a heart full of Gratitude - Indrani</p>
