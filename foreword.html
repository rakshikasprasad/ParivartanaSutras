        <p>One sure method of transforming oneself from
 a human being to the Divine Being (Potential
 Being) is the cultivation of the qualities
 described in this book. </p>
        <p>By cultivating these qualities, one can make
 things happen and thus become master of one's
 own destiny. All the universal forces will
 become co-operative and one will effortlessly
 attract luck and good fortune.</p>
        <p> These qualities are both inwardly regenerative
 and outwardly practical. They will take care of
 our worldly prosperity and spiritual progress.</p>
 <p>After a little sincere practice, these qualities will
 evolve naturally in the hearts of those who
 attune themselves to the Divine Mother.</p>
 <p>Selfless dedication to the Divine Mother will
 take care of everything in our lives.These
 qualities represent the summation of all
 spiritual practices. </p>
 <p>It was possible to finalise them after nearly 60
 years of study and research. The names of the
 qualities are taken from the Bhagavad Gita, the
 Yoga sutras of Patanjali, Lalitopakhyanam and
 Valmiki Ramayana.</p>
 <p> In the beginning, meditate on each quality for
 a minute. Let the seed of each quality sink into
 you. Also if any quality is violated at any time
 during daily life, become aware of the violation.
 Rectify and regulate yourself then and there
 with a resolve to see that such violations do not
 recur.</p>
 <p>Place these qualities first and foremost in your
 lives and enjoy peace, patience, kindness,
 happiness, goodness and
 gentleness.
